# Change the Already Subscribed Text

This text is displayed when a user visits a page where the Stripe shortcode is added and the user is already subscribed to a plan.

The default text is `You're already subscribed`.

``` php
add_filter( 'umm_stripe_already_subscribed_text', 'um_1092023_stripe_already_subscribed_text ', 10, 1 )
function um_1092023_stripe_already_subscribed_text( $subscribed_text ){

    $subscribed_text = __( "Hey, you've already subscribed to a plan!", "your-textdomain" );

    return $subscribed_text;
}
```
