# Introduction to Stripe Extension
 Ultimate Member - Stripe extension allows you to integrate Stripe Checkout Page and Customer Billing features. With this extension, customers are redirected to an externally hosted checkout page and customer billing page, allowing users to pay, subscribe, and manage plans. This also allows you to restrict content( shortcode, post, pages, tags &amp; taxonomies ) by Stripe Plans and updates a user's role by Stripe subscription statuses via Webhook.

 Stripe is a simple way to accept payments online. Stripe has no setup fees, no monthly fees, and no hidden costs. Hundreds of thousands of businesses—from startups to Fortune 500 companies—rely on Stripe’s software tools to accept payments and expand globally securely.

 Stripe is available to businesses in  [40+ countries](https://stripe.com/global) . With Stripe, you can accept all major debit and credit cards from customers in every country in 135+ currencies, as well as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other  [local payment methods](https://stripe.com/en-US/payments/payment-methods-guide#payment-method-fact-sheets) , such as Alipay, iDeal, or SEPA Direct Debit.

 The following guides aim to teach you how to get started, explaining the available features and options.
