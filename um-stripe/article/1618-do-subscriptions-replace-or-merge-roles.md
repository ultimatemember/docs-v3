# Stripe FAQ - Do Subscriptions Replace or Merge Roles?
 By default, the Stripe module merges the role into the user when subscription statuses change. You can change this behavior to replace the role instead of merging them. Go to WP-Admin &gt; Ultimate Member &gt; Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Stripe &gt; <strong>Replace existing roles when the subscription status has changed.</strong>

> <strong>Note:</strong> This will replace all roles when "replace existing roles" is enabled/checked. If you're using an Administrator account, the role will not change. It's best to use a subscriber account as a test account.
