# FAQ - Do Subscriptions Replace or Merge Roles?
<p>
	 By default, the Stripe module merges the role into the user when subscription statuses change. You can change this behavior to replace the role instead of merging them. Go to WP-Admin &gt; Ultimate Member &gt; Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Stripe &gt; 
	<strong>Replace existing roles when the subscription status has changed.<br>
	</strong></p><p>

	<strong>Note:</strong> This will replace all roles when "replace existing roles" is enabled/checked. If you're using an Administrator account, the role will not change. It's best to use a subscriber account as a test account.
