# Create & Test Customer Billings
<p>
	 For customers to manage their plans and view the billing history, Stripe has a Customer Billing Portal page that you can integrate into your site with a shortcode.</p>
<pre>[ultimatemember_stripe_customer_portal]
</pre><p>
	 Ultimate Member Stripe module creates a Stripe account using the customer's email address. This will allow Stripe to generate a Customer Billing Portal. When you add the shortcode to the page, the page's URL will become the Return URL of the Customer Billing Portal for users to return to your site.</p><p>
	 To manage the Customer Billing Portal features and functionalities, please go to <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal">https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal</a></p><h3>NEXT: <a href="https://ultimatemember.github.io/docs-v3/um-stripe/article/1610-stripe---test-your-integration">Test Your Integration</a></h3>
