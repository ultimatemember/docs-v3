# Create & Test Customer Billings
<p>Stripe provides a <strong>Customer Billing Portal</strong> page that you can integrate into your site using a shortcode to display a button or link for customers to manage their plans and view their billing history. For the redirection to work, the user must be logged in.</p>

	The Ultimate Member Stripe extension creates an account using the customer's email address. This will allow Stripe to generate a Customer Billing Portal. When you add the shortcode to the page, the URL will become the Return URL of the Customer Billing Portal for users to return to your site.</p><p>
