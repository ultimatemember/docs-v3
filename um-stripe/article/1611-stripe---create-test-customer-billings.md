# Create & Test Customer Billings
 Stripe provides a <strong>Customer Billing Portal</strong> page that you can integrate into your site using a shortcode to display a button or link for customers to manage their plans and view their billing history. For the redirection to work, the user must be logged in.

```
[ultimatemember_stripe_customer_portal]
```

 The Ultimate Member Stripe extension creates an account using the customer's email address. This will allow Stripe to generate a Customer Billing Portal. When you add the shortcode to the page, the URL will become the Return URL of the Customer Billing Portal for users to return to your site.

 To manage the Customer Billing Portal's appearance, features, and functionalities, please visit  [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal) .
