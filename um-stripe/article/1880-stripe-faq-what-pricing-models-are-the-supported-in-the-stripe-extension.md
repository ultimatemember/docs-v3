# Stripe FAQ - What Pricing Models are supported in the Stripe extension?
<p>
	The initial version supports a Flat-rate pricing model( One-time payment and recurring) for one-level membership. We are working on a feature that can support Per-Seat and usage-based pricing models together with the extension's Usage Records API. For more details, you can check our development roadmap in <a href="https://ultimate-member-roadmaps.notion.site/54b8d1929df44079a7c0ccdc14ab6220?v=400225114a5349b4aaf958d02bc08a5f&pvs=4">the link</a>.</p>
