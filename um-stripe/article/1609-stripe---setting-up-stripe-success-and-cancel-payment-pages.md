# Setting up Success, Cancel Payment and Already Subscribed Pages
<p>
	 When a user attempts to subscribe and is then redirected to the Stripe Checkout page, there are 2 pages the user will be redirected to. A user will be redirected to the Success Page when the payment is completed or started trialing. On the other hand, a user is redirected to the Cancelled Page when a user clicks on the Back button in the Stripe Checkout Page.</p><p>
	 To set the Success and Cancelled Pages, go to WP Admin &gt; Ultimate Member &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Pages.</p><p>

	 Upon the Stripe module activation, it will display that there are pages that need to be created. When you hit the "Create Pages", it will create the Stripe Pages and then automatically assign them to the Page settings.</p><h3>NEXT: <a href="https://ultimatemember.github.io/docs-v3/um-stripe/article/1617-create-subscription-prices">Create Subscription Prices</a></h3>
