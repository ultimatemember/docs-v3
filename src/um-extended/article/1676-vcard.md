# Vcard
Overview
--------

 With this extension, users can conveniently generate a VCard upon registering and after updating their profile. The process is made hassle-free as they can easily download the VCard.vcf file, ensuring that their contact information is readily available in a universally compatible format. This seamless integration not only simplifies the user experience but also provides a practical solution for sharing and storing contact details. Say goodbye to manual data entry and hello to efficiency with the automatic VCard generation feature.

 <strong>Note: The VCard file must be generated by updating the User Profile. Until this update, there is no VCard file available.</strong>

 <strong>Download:</strong> In UM  [Extended 2.0.3](https://github.com/ultimatemember/Extended/releases)  under the Assets, click on the Source code(zip) to download the zip file.

 When a user registers or saves their profile, a <strong>VCard.vcf</strong> file is generated, and a VCard icon is shown in their profile allowing users to download the file. The VCard or.vcf file may be imported into the Contacts Application on <strong>Mac OS</strong>, <strong>Google Contacts</strong>, and <strong>Outlook on Windows OS</strong>.  
   
 The VCard field will appear or will be generated on the user's profile <strong>only when the user edits and updates</strong> their profile.

### Action hook

 You can use the action hook `um_vcard_before_save` to add extra fields to the VCard. See the example below:

 ```
add_action('um_vcard_before_save','um_vcard_add_nickname', 10, 2 ); 
function um_vcard_add_nickname( $vcard_obj, $user_id ){    
	$vcard_obj->add( new Nickname( um_user('nickname' ) ) ); 
}
	
```
