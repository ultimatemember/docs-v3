# Regenerate Cover & Profile Photo thumbnails
Overview
--------

 The UM Regenerate Thumbnails plugin allows you to regenerate thumbnails of profile photos and cover photos based on the original uploaded image files. UM saves the original cover/photo image and uses it to generate thumbnails. It is good to use if you are trying to create a custom profile/member directory template that requires different image sizes. You can read the plugin installation guide  [here.](/docs-v3/um-extended/article/1663-download-installation-of-the-basic-extensions)

 Once the plugin is activated,  <strong>Regenerate Thumbnails</strong> will be added to the Ultimate Member menu tab.
