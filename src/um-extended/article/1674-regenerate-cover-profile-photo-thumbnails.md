# Regenerate Cover & Profile Photo thumbnails
Overview
--------

 The Ultimate Member Regenerate Thumbnails plugin simplifies the process of regenerating profile photos and cover photos by utilizing the original uploaded image files. UM retains the original cover/photo image and employs it to generate thumbnails, providing a practical solution for situations where custom image sizes are needed. This is particularly useful when creating a personalized profile or member directory template that requires diverse image dimensions, offering flexibility and ease in adapting your site to specific design requirements. For the installation guide, go to this  [article](/docs-v3/um-extended/article/1889-installation) . 

 Upon activation of the plugin, you'll find a convenient addition to the Ultimate Member menu tabâ€”the <strong>"Regenerate Thumbnails"</strong> option. This streamlined accessibility allows users to initiate thumbnail regeneration directly from the Ultimate Member menu.
