### Clear User Cache

 Go to <strong>wp-admin &gt; Ultimate Member &gt; Dashboard &gt; User Cache.</strong> You need to clear the user cache to refresh data; this is needed if the generated dummies' profiles and cover photos do not appear. Once you click the clear cache button, a confirmation message will indicate that the cache has been removed.
