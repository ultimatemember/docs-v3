# Block Disposable Email Domains
### Overview

 Disposable Email Domains are temporary in the sense that they may expire or self-destruct. This plugin will help you update your Block Email Address option to detect spam or disposable email domains in the Ultimate Member's Register Forms, allowing you to prevent Spam Registration. For the installation and setup guide, go  [here.](/docs-v3/um-extended/article/1889-installation)

### Block Disposable Email Domains

 Once activated, this will update the list of blocked email domains in  <strong>Ultimate Member &gt; Settings &gt; Access &gt; Other &gt; Blocked Disposable Email Domains</strong>. The extension updates the list daily if there's a new disposable email domain to block. This merges with the Blocked Emails option, so you can add your Email address and Domains using the existing option.
