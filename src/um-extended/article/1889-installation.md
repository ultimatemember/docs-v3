# Installation
 This article serves as a guide for installing the basic extension, offering step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth installation process.



1. Download the latest version of the Extended plugin from this  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultimatemember/Extended/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to your local computer.
3. There are two ways to use the extended plugin: 
    - <strong>Individual extensions:</strong> You can use individual extensions or plugins in the /Extended/src/ directory, and upload them to your site. 
        - For example, If you only need the Browser Detect plugin: 
            - Click on the `Individual-Extensions.zip`  to download the extensions. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/561c96629033600a7a36d662/images/65578310faa0932173ab7952/file-aPSJLfrflX.png)
            - After downloading, extract the file. The resulting extraction forms a folder named "<strong>assets</strong>," containing separate zip files for each basic extension.

            - Upload it to your site by selecting only the um-browser-detect zip and once the plugin is uploaded and activated, it will automatically enable all features &amp; functionalities related to the plugin/extension.
    - <strong>Whole Extended plugin:</strong> Upload the whole Extended plugin zip file to your site and enable each extension on the Extended settings. 
        - Once you activate the plugin, it will add the "<strong>UM Extended"</strong> tab to the WP Side navigation menu.
        - Clicking the "UM Extended" tab will display all the Ultimate Member Basic Extensions. You have the option to enable and activate all the extensions by clicking the <strong>"Enable All Active"</strong> toggle switch button.
