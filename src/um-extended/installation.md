# Getting Started

Ultimate Member plugin providees many features & functionalities as a base for developing Membership & Communitiy sites with WordPress. It has a lot of available Filter & Action hooks to help extend and customize the plugin depending on the type of membership sites that you are developing. 

There are many approaches in building membership/community sites with Ultimate Member but there's a limitation: not all features & functionalities are implemented as the base only includes the most popularly known & used features/functionalities. With the help of this Extended plugin, it compiles all those missing basic features & functionalities contributed & shared by many of our community developers so you may use them freely.

## Installation

2. Extract the zip file to your local computer.
3. There are two ways to use the extended plugin: 
    - You can use individual extensions or plugins in the /Extended/src/ directory, zip each plugin, and upload them to your site. For example, If you only need the Browser Detect plugin, just copy/zip the /um-browser-detect/ directory and upload it to your site. Once the plugin is uploaded and activated, it will automatically enable all features &amp; functionalities related to the plugin/extension.
    - Upload the whole Extended plugin zip file to your site and enable each extension on the Extended settings. 
        - Once you activate the plugin, it will add the "<strong>UM Extended"</strong> tab to the WP Side navigation menu.
        - Clicking the "UM Extended" tab will display all the Ultimate Member Basic Extensions. You have the option to enable and activate all the extensions by clicking the <strong>"Enable All Active"</strong> toggle switch button.
