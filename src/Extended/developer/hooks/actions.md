> **Where to put the code?**
>
> Any time you add a custom PHP function to your site, insert it in the Code Snippets plugin (recommended), a child theme's functions.php, or your custom plugin. The [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin is the recommended option. 
>> **IMPORTANT:** Before making any PHP changes, make sure you have FTP access so you can still access your site if there are any mistakes in your code. 
>
> You can find more details in the  [WordPress docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/) if you need to get more familiar with using WordPress action/filters.
