 Since Ultimate Member uses Twitter API for our Social Login Plugin Extension, these changes will significantly affect us. However, there still needs to be full details if the Login with Twitter will be removed. Our team is preparing for the upcoming modifications. Please keep in mind the forthcoming notices and updates from our team.
