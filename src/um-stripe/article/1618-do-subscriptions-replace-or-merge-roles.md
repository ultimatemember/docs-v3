# Stripe FAQ - Do Subscriptions Replace or Merge Roles?
 By default, when a subscription status changes, the Stripe Plan assigns a new role to a user along with the existing role. If you want to swap roles, you can enable this option so that when a subscription status changes, it removes the existing roles and assign a new role.Go to WP-Admin &gt; Ultimate Member &gt; Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Stripe &gt; <strong>Replace existing roles when a subscription status changes.</strong>

> <strong>Note:</strong> This will replace all roles when "replace existing roles" is enabled/checked. If you're using an Administrator account, the role will not change. It's best to use a subscriber account as a test account.
