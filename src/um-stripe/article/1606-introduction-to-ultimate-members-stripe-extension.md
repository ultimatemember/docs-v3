- <strong>Checkout &amp; Customer Billing Pages</strong> allow users to pay, subscribe, and manage plans on your site.
- <strong>Restrict Contents by Stripe Plans and Prices</strong> allows you to restrict content (shortcodes, posts, pages, tags, and taxonomies) by Stripe plans or prices.
- <strong>Update a user's role by Stripe subscription statuses via Webhook</strong>
- <strong>Support Payment Link for Checkout</strong> allows you to display the icons of the supported payment methods using the button setting features.
